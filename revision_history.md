# Revision History

##Â 3.0-SNAPSHOT (being developed in the JDK11 branch) 
  * **FROM NOW ON, JDK < 11 IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED**. java2rdf will possibly work with 1.8 for a
  while (until we start introducing incompatible changes), but that's not officially 
  supported.

## 2.1.3-SNAPSHOT
  * Just started

## 2.1.3
  * Needed to amend dependency error.

## 2.1
  * Migration to Jena 3.9.0.
  * Bugfix in `RdfTrueGenerator`.

## 2.0.1
  * Needed to amend dependency error.
  
## 2.0
  * Migration to rdfutils package, and OWLApi/Jena pluggability.

## 1.0
  * First actual release. This was made before substantial changes and with the purpose to keep some 
  track of the version that was used in projects like EBI RDF platform (used to be 1.0-SNAPSHOT). It was 
  changed straight after, so never actually used.
