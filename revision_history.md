# Revision History

## 2.0-SNAPSHOT

  * Migration to rdfutils package, and OWLApi/Jena pluggability. 

## 1.0

  * First actual release. This was made before substantial changes and with the purpose to keep some 
  track of the version that was used in projects like EBI RDF platform (used to be 1.0-SNAPSHOT). It was 
  changed straight after, so never actually used.
