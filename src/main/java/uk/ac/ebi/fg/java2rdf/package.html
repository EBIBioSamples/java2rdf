<h1>The Java2RDF Mapper Library</h1>
<p>This is a small library that allow you to define how to map Java objects to RDF statements in a declarative way. This 
has the same purpose of packages like TODO, however here we aim at making it possible to define mappings without Java
annotations, which is useful in certain cases, e.g., when you are trying to use a 3rd party library and you can't modify
its sources.</p>

<p>See the JUnit tests for details.</p>

<p>TODO: re-arrange the mappers into multiple packages.</p>
